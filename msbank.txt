Creating and managing a number of microservices effectively requires careful planning and consideration of 
various factors, including scalability, maintainability, and performance. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to determine 
the number of microservices for the OTP and email verification requirements:

### **1. Define Microservice Boundaries**

Microservices should be designed around business capabilities. For your OTP and email verification requirements, 
you might consider the following microservices:

1. **User Management Service:**
   - Handles user registration, profile management, and basic user information.

2. **OTP Service:**
   - Manages OTP generation, storage, validation, and expiration.
   - Communicates with the User Management Service to link OTPs with user accounts.

3. **Email Verification Service:**
   - Manages email verification token generation, sending emails, and token validation.
   - Communicates with the User Management Service to link email verification tokens with user accounts.

4. **Notification Service:**
   - Handles sending SMS for OTPs and email notifications.
   - Can be extended to handle other types of notifications in the future.

5. **Audit Service:**
   - Tracks and logs all verification and OTP-related events for auditing purposes.
   - Can be used for compliance and debugging.

6. **Gateway Service:**
   - Acts as an entry point to the system, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
   - Handles cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and rate limiting.

### **2. Microservice Design Principles**

#### **1. User Management Service**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - User registration and profile updates.
  - Integrates with OTP and Email Verification services to verify users.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/register`
  - `/update-profile`
  - `/get-user-details`

- **Database:**
  - Stores user data and links to OTP and email verification status.

#### **2. OTP Service**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Generates and validates OTPs.
  - Stores OTPs with expiration times.
  - Provides APIs for OTP generation and validation.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/generate-otp`
  - `/validate-otp`

- **Database:**
  - Stores OTP records (mobileNumber, otp, expirationTime).

#### **3. Email Verification Service**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Generates and validates email verification tokens.
  - Sends verification emails.
  - Provides APIs for email verification.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/send-verification-email`
  - `/verify-email`

- **Database:**
  - Stores email verification tokens (email, token, expirationTime).

#### **4. Notification Service**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Sends SMS and email notifications.
  - Can handle different notification types and providers.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/send-sms`
  - `/send-email`

- **Integration:**
  - Integrates with OTP Service and Email Verification Service to send notifications.

#### **5. Audit Service**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Logs events related to OTP and email verification.
  - Provides auditing and monitoring capabilities.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `/log-event`
  - `/get-audit-log`

- **Database:**
  - Stores logs and audit trails.

#### **6. Gateway Service**

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
  - Handles authentication, rate limiting, and logging.

- **Endpoints:**
  - Acts as a proxy to other services.

### **3. Deployment and Management**

- **Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize each microservice for consistent deployment.
- **Orchestration:** Use Kubernetes for managing and scaling microservices.
- **Service Discovery:** Implement service discovery mechanisms (e.g., Eureka, Consul) to enable microservices to find each other dynamically.
- **Configuration Management:** Use a centralized configuration management system (e.g., Spring Cloud Config) to manage configuration properties.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for observability.

### **4. Communication and Data Management**

- **Asynchronous Communication:** Use Kafka for asynchronous communication between services (e.g., OTP generation and validation events).
- **Synchronous Communication:** Use REST or gRPC for synchronous communication between services.
- **Data Management:** Design microservices to own their data and manage it independently. Avoid direct database access between microservices.

### **5. Example Microservice Architecture**

- **User Management Service** interacts with **OTP Service** and **Email Verification Service** to validate users.
- **OTP Service** and **Email Verification Service** send notifications through the **Notification Service**.
- **Audit Service** logs events from **OTP Service** and **Email Verification Service**.
- **Gateway Service** routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles cross-cutting concerns.

By following this approach, you can create a scalable, high-performance system with clear boundaries and responsibilities 
for each microservice, ensuring maintainability and flexibility in production.
